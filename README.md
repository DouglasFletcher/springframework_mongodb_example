# CRUD operations in MongoDB & OracleDB
This repo gives an idea of how to set up CRUD operations in MongoDB vs OracleDB using java spring framework. The schema is not so complex but as a first user case, should be sufficient. 
So far only insertOne, insertMany, getOne, getMany with JUnit tests are created for MongoDB only.
